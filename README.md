Software Engineering Day1 Assignment
#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering involves systematically applying engineering principles, methods and tools to develop and maintain high quality softwares. This involves designing, testing, deployment and maintance of software products.
Software engineering plays an important role in technology industry because it enables creation of software apllications and systems that are useful in various aspects of life including: entertainment industry(such as development of gaming apps),healthacare, communication(such as the development of apps such as instagram) and in web applications such as google and in commerce.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Key milestions included : the development of programming languages such as C, This ensured systematic planning and execution:
the establishment of software engineering as a disciple in the 1960s,
the introduction of Objected oriented proramming in the 1960s to 1970s such as C++ and 
the rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s. Agile methodologies shifted the focus from rigid to more iterative customer focused development processes.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements:Involves gathering detailed requirements and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Designing: Involves creating system architecture and design specifications.
Implementation: Involves the development of the code based on the design.
Testing: Ensuring that the software meets requirementsa and is free of bugs.
Deployment: Releasing the software to the end users.
Maintenance: Providing ongiong support and enhancement of the software

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
They are both methodologies used in software development
Waterfall has a sequential,structured process approach while Agile has a interactive, flexible process approach.
Waterfall follows a linear, step by step approach while agile works in small,continous cyles.
Waterfall is rigid while agile is highly adaptable.
Waterfall is best suited for projects with clear and fixed requirements while agile is best suited for projects with evolving requirements

Examples of scenarios
Waterfall: Development of Medical equipment , Banking system development
Agile:  Mobile app development, website development,Development of games

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer : Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
Quality Assuranvce Engineer:Desinging and executing test plans to ensure the software meets the quality standards.
Project Manager: Oversieing the planning, execution and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Importance of IDES and VCS: They enhance productivity,collaboration and code quality.
Intergrated Development Environments are software suites that provide tools for writing, debugging and testing code. Examples inclide Visual Studio, Eclipse 
Version Control Systems are Software tools for tracking changes to Soft code amd coordinating work among team members. Examples include GIT hub, Subversion

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Challenge:
Changing Requirements
Tight deadlines leading to pressure to develop software products to meet deadlines resulting in rushed development

Strategies:
Can be overcome by using Agile methodologies
Proper and effective communication of the time required to develop softwares.
Reassestment of project goals and timelines

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit: Involves testing individual components or modules of the software.
Intergration: Involves testing the interactions between diffferent components or subsystems.
System: Involves testing the entire system as a whole
Acceptance: Involves testinf the software against the requirements of the user so as to ensure itb meets its needs

Impotance in software quality assurance: 
It helps to identify and fix any defects early in the development process. This leads to higher quality software products.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering
Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt enginerring is the art of crafting questions or statements to get the best responses from AI models.
It helps get clear and accurate responses from AI hence improving AI usability, presicion and efficiency.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt example: Tell me about technology (does not specify which aspect of technology)
Improved version:   Write a two paragraph report on the impact of AI in healthcare ,focusing on the diagnosis and patients care ,and give a recent example.
The improved prompt is more effective because it gives more clarity and narrows the response to a more specific topic.
